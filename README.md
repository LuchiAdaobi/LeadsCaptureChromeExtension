LeadCapture App
This is a simple web application that allows you to save and manage a list of leads (URLs) for future reference. You can add new leads, delete individual leads, delete all leads, search for specific leads, and even save the currently active tab as a lead.

Getting Started
To use this application, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. The app will load, and you can start managing your leads right away.

Features
Saving Leads
You can save leads by entering the URL in the input field and clicking the "Save" button. The lead will be added to the list if it is not already present.

Deleting Leads
To delete a single lead, click the "x" button next to the lead you want to remove. The lead will be removed from the list, and the changes will be saved automatically.

To delete all leads, double-click the "Delete All" button. This action will clear the entire list of leads, and the changes will be saved automatically.

Viewing Leads
All your saved leads are displayed in a list format. Each lead is presented as a clickable link, allowing you to open it in a new tab. To visit a lead, simply click on the link.

Searching Leads
You can search for specific leads by typing your search query in the search input field. The list will dynamically update, showing only the leads that match your search term.

Saving the Active Tab
By clicking the "Save Tab" button, the currently active tab in your web browser will be saved as a lead. If the URL of the active tab is already in the list, it will not be saved again.

Local Storage
The application uses local storage to persist your saved leads. When you add, delete, or modify leads, the changes are automatically saved in the local storage of your browser. When you revisit the app, your leads will be loaded from the local storage, ensuring your data is retained between sessions.

Please note that this application uses the Chrome tabs API to save the active tab. It may not work as expected in browsers other than Chrome.

Feel free to explore and use this simple lead management application to stay organized and keep track of important URLs!
